I won't run away from you
I won't run away from you

I won't run away from you
And I won't try to hide myself
For one more time

I won't run away from you
I won't run away from you
I won't run away from you

So many people come and go
They can be mean but they won't show
Smilin' to all you've said
Talking behind your back
But I won't care forevermore

When I'm feelin' like a stranger
Lost in the universe
When it's cold
I know you'll come and warm my heart, you you

I won't run away from you
And I won't try to hide myself
For one more time
(I won't run away from you)
Won't you please, please tell me who I am
'Cause I can only feel myself
When you are mine
(I won't run away from you)

So many people interfere
They know it all and disappear
They didn't know a thing
Wonders are happening
They said our love won't find a way

When you're feelin' like a stranger
Lost in the universe
I'll be there
It doesn't matter where you are, you you

I won't run away from you
And I won't try to hide myself
For one more time
(I won't run away from you)
Won't you please, please tell me who I am
'Cause I can only feel myself
When you are mine
(I won't run away from you)

I won't run away from you
And I won't try to hide myself
For one more time
(I won't run away from you)
Won't you please, please tell me who I am
'Cause I can only feel myself
When you are mine
(I won't run away from you)

I won't run away from you
Run away from you
I won't run away from you
