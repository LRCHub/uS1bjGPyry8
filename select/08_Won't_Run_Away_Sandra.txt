I won't run away from you,
And I won't try to hide myself for one more time...
Won't you please, please tell me who I am?
Cause I can only feel myself, when you are mine...

So many people come and go,
They can be mean but they won't show,

Smiling to all you've said, talking behind your back,
But I won't care forevermore...

When I'm feeling like a stranger, lost in the universe,
When it's cold, I know you'll come and warm my heart,

I won't run away from you
And I won't try to hide myself for one more time,
(I won't run away from you, I won't run away from you)
Won't you please, please tell me who I am?
Cause I can only feel myself, when you are mine...
(I won't run away from you, I won't run away from you)
I won't run away from you...

So many people interfere,
They know it all and disappear...

They didn't know a thing, Wonders are happening,
They said our love won't find a way...

When I'm feeling like a stranger, lost in the universe,
When it's cold, I know you'll come and warm my heart,

I won't run away from you
And I won't try to hide myself for one more time,
(I won't run away from you, I won't run away from you)
Won't you please, please tell me who I am?
Cause I can only feel myself, when you are mine...
(I won't run away from you, I won't run away from you)

I won't run away from you
And I won't try to hide myself for one more time,
Won't you please, please tell me who I am?
Cause I can only feel myself, when you are mine...
(I won't run away from you, I won't run away from you)

When you are mine...
When you are mine...

I won't run away from you!
