And I, and I
And I wanna be that sleep that brings your dreams
And I wanna be that need that plants that seed
And I wanna be that beast, you'll wanna feed
And I wanna be that horse that's running it's course
And I wanna be that fire, wanna be that fire

Let's just run away, so far away
From those things we do everyday
Let's just run away, so far away
From those things we do everyday

Let's just run away, so far away
From those things we do everyday
Let's just run away, so far away
From those things we do everyday

Oh, let's take those beautiful days, tuck them away
For those days when it's hard to play
Those days when it's hard to say
Those days when nothing goes your way
Those days, those days, our days, our days

Let's just run away, so far away
From those things we do everyday
Let's just run away, so far away
From those things we do everyday

Let's just run away, so far away
From those things we do everyday
Let's just run away, so far away
From those things we do everyday
