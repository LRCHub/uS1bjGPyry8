Why do you runaway now?
Do you run away now
You're gonna let me down, let me down
Why do you runaway now?
Do you run away now
You're gonna let me down

Anything to make you mine
Write your name across the sky
Love's about to change my heart
I'll be crazy from the start
I can't wait too long for you
I'll be crazy from the start

Jam, jam, i wanna jam, jam
Jam, jam, i wanna jam
Jam, jam, i wanna jam, jam
Jam, jam, don't runaway from me

I've been waiting for so long
Now i see that i was wrong
Love's about to change my heart
This heartache you put me through
Is gonna make us stay apart
I wanna see my dreams come true

Jam, jam, i wanna jam, jam
Jam, jam, i wanna jam
Jam, jam, i wanna jam, jam
Jam, jam, don't runaway from me
