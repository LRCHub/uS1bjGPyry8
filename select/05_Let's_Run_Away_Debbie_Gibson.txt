VERSE1:
In your mind's eye
I see what you won't say
Why is the truth so rare
It's not the lighting
It's not the day
And I know it's not that you don't care

CHORUS:
Love is not a secret to take to the grave
Why won't you run away with me tomorrow
We could dance under moonlight
Play catch with the stars all day
Let's run away

VERSE2:
Imagine a place
Where pride could cease to exist
And we could not speak of pain
And angels carry us on their wings
We are kissed
As we bathe in the pouring rain

CHORUS

BRIDGE:
I cannot pretend
Oh no not to care
Anymore
So look inside
And come out smiling
With eyes of the adored

CHORUS:
Why don't you run away with me tomorrow
We could dance under moonlight
Play catch with the stars all day
Let's run away

CHORUS:
Love is not a secret to take to the grave
Let's run away tomorrow
We could dance under moonlight
Play catch with the stars all day
Let's run away

Love is not a secret
Love is not a secret
